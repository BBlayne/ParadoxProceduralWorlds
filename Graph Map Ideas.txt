A graph based map is made up of nodes or cells. 


Delaunay Graph
Voronoi Graph 

DelaunayFactory

VoronoiFactory

The delaunay and voronoi maps are mainly a means to an end; we want at the end 
the barycentric dual mesh with a convenient API to do computations on without 
having to constantly throw away and redo work.

// Blobs

Int Array of Cells, i.e: Cells[...]

CellGraph

A cell should have, 
	a list of neighbouring cells.
	it's id.
	some payload of data to be filled later (terrain type, etc).
	a list of surrounding edges. // may not match list of neighbours.
	a centroid i.e the location of its center of mass. 
	
It should be possible for a cell on an edge of the map to connect to a cell 
at the opposite adjacent edge of the map.
